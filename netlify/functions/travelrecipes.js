However, new research suggests you might go ahead and eat your whole eggs. It turns out egg yolk contains valuable nutrients (the cartenoids that make it yellow are great for eye health, folic acid is great for brain health, and it has vitamins A, E, D, and K) and <a href="https://spoonacular.com/academy/cholesterol">dietary cholesterol</a> seems to have little influence on blood cholesterol levels.',

The problem with consuming too much salt (what chemists call "sodium chloride") is actually the <a href="https://spoonacular.com/academy/sodium">sodium</a> part, which is why people concerned about high blood pressure go on low-sodium diets. If you are trying to reduce salt in your diet, you can try salt substitutes like potassium chloride or try to make do with less salt by using more black pepper, herbs, and spices.',

            'Butter\'s incredible flavor has made it an extremely popular cooking fat, but it is important to know that butter has the lowest smoke point of almost any cooking fat. This means butter literally starts to smoke at a lower temperature than most other fats between 250-350 degrees Fahrenheit.

This means butter literally starts to smoke at a lower temperature than most other fats between 250-350 degrees Fahrenheit. So while butter is great for cooking at lower temperatures, you should probably use canola oil, coconut oil, or  <a href="https://spoonacular.com/academy/vegetable-oil">another oil with a higher smoke point</a> for frying and other high temperature cooking.',

Whack down on the flat side of the blade with your free hand to smoosh the garlic a bit. Done correctly, the skin will peel right off.",

Place the lid securely into place, set the valve to "seal" and then put the Instant Pot on manual for 8 minutes.When the cooking time is finished, allow the Instant Pot to naturally release pressure for 10 minutes before moving the valve t0 "vent". I always cover mine with a hand towel just in case any thing decided to spurt out of the lid.Once the pressure has been released, remove the inner pot and drain the excess water.Place the potatoes into a bowl and add cream cheese, butter, milk, sour cream, and salt and pepper. Mash the potatoes really well and mix everything up good. Add in the chopped green onion and mix again. Serve immediately or save them for later.',

            "White Wine, Alcoholic Drink, and Ingredient are great choices for Chicken Tenders. White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Asnella Vinho Verde. It has 4.5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 15 dollars.",

Sauvignon Blanc and Gruner Veltliner both have herby notes that complement salads with enough acid to match tart vinaigrettes, while a Chardonnay can be a good pick for creamy salad dressings. One wine you could try is Tenuta di Nozzole Le Bruniche Chardonnay. It has 4.4 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 12 dollars.",

                "Nozzole Le Bruniche is an elegant and distinctive expression of the Chardonnay variety, with a clean, fragrant bouquet of white and tropical fruits offset by slight nuances of toast. On the palate, it shows a superb balance of fruit ripeness underscored by a fresh acidity and structure of medium body, with an overall impression of delicate complexity. These are repeated in the clean, persistent finish, which ends on a subtle toasty note.",

You're only gaining a little fat for a lot of flavor. Plus, a little over half of the fat in chicken skin is monounsatured fat (that's a heart-healthy kind) and the notion that saturated fat is unhealthy is being <a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/news/2014/03March/Pages/Saturated-fats-and-heart-disease-link-unproven.aspx\">questioned</a> too. So in our opinion: dig in, skin and all!",

Sea salt is usually 97.5% sodium chloride (same as regular old table salt) and the minerals accounting for the rest are too insignificant to make a difference?unless you plan on consuming sea salt by the pound, in which case the health benefits from the minerals will definitely be outweighed by the negative effects of all the sodium you are consuming!",

Don't hesitate to include some healthy fats in this dish to get the most health benefits from the tomatoes!",

The problem with consuming too much salt (what chemists call "sodium chloride") is actually the <a href="https://spoonacular.com/academy/sodium">sodium</a> part, which is why people concerned about high blood pressure go on low-sodium diets. If you are trying to reduce salt in your diet, you can try salt substitutes like potassium chloride or try to make do with less salt by using more black pepper, herbs, and spices.',

So if you have expensive sea salt, save it for sprinkling on salads or dark chocolate cookies, don't try to use it in your pasta sauce or soup.

            'Extra-virgin olive oil is the least refined type of olive oil and therefore contains more of the beneficial compounds that get lost during processing. However, its minimal processing could also mean it has a lower smoke point than other olive oils. Once an oil starts to smoke, it begins to break down, producing a bad flavor and potentially harmful compounds. Unfortunately, the smoke point of an oil depends on so many factors that it is hard to say what the smoke point of an oil really is. For extra-virgin olive oil, it could be anywhere between 200-400 degrees Fahrenheit. Most people recommend using extra-virgin olive oil to add flavor to a finished dish or in cold dishes to be on the safe side.

            "Spanish Tortilla works really well with Tempranillo, Grenache, and Albarino. When pairing wine with Spanish dishes, why not follow the rule 'what grows together goes together'? We recommend albariño for white wine and garnachan and tempranillo for red. You could try Enate Tempranillo. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.8 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 16 dollars per bottle.",

                "Nuances of strawberry sweets and liquorish mingle playfully with red berries and cherries. The fusion of flavorsome tannins and fresh acidity brings about a smooth and well-rounded texture, which in turn leads to a creamy finish on the palate.Due to the wine's youthful character, it is best to serve it lightly chilled. It is the perfect accompaniment to Spanish tapas such as cod croquettes, black pudding and black rice without forgetting cold fish dishes and pasta.",

            'Here is an easy health swap: substitute brown rice for white rice. Brown rice is a whole grain, while white rice is brown rice stripped of some of its parts and much of its fiber and other nutrients. It is important to note, however, that all rice types raise your <a href="http://www.health.harvard.edu/newsweek/Glycemic_index_and_glycemic_load_for_100_foods.htm">blood sugar</a> and should be eaten in moderation. In fact, if it seems like it would work in the recipe, the best option would probably be so-called <a href="http://spoonacular.com/Another-(simpler)-Version-Of-Cauliflower-Rice-30679">cauliflower rice</a>.',
            'If you\'re worried about cholesterol and heart disease, you may have heard you should limit your egg consumption to one egg per day or eat only egg whites. However, new research suggests you might go ahead and eat your whole eggs. It turns out egg yolk contains valuable nutrients (the cartenoids that make it yellow are great for eye health, folic acid is great for brain health, and it has vitamins A, E, D, and K) and <a href="https://spoonacular.com/academy/cholesterol">dietary cholesterol</a> seems to have little influence on blood cholesterol levels.',

            'Butter\'s incredible flavor has made it an extremely popular cooking fat, but it is important to know that butter has the lowest smoke point of almost any cooking fat. This means butter literally starts to smoke at a lower temperature than most other fats between 250-350 degrees Fahrenheit. So while butter is great for cooking at lower temperatures, you should probably use canola oil, coconut oil, or  <a href="https://spoonacular.com/academy/vegetable-oil">another oil with a higher smoke point</a> for frying and other high temperature cooking.',

Take a knife with a thick blade and place the blade flat across the garlic clove (the clove should be closer to the handle than the middle of the blade). Whack down on the flat side of the blade with your free hand to smoosh the garlic a bit. Done correctly, the skin will peel right off.",

Sauvignon Blanc and Gruner Veltliner both have herby notes that complement salads with enough acid to match tart vinaigrettes, while a Chardonnay can be a good pick for creamy salad dressings. One wine you could try is Maison Noir Knock on Wood Chardonnay. It has 4.6 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 18 dollars.",

Procured from hillside vineyards in Yamhill-Carlton AVA, reminiscent of the grand crus of Burgundy's Cote d'Or. It benefited from a very long and cold fermentation - almost two months - resulting in a lean and mean wine with perfume of honeydew melon and pear surfing huge waves of minerals, bringing a nice tide of racy starfruit to the finish.",

With the pomegranate still in the bowl of water, carefully release the seeds from the pomegranate membranes. The seeds will sink so you can easily remove the floating pieces.

Brown rice is a whole grain, while white rice is brown rice stripped of some of its parts and much of its fiber and other nutrients.

Plus, a little over half of the fat in chicken skin is monounsatured fat (that's a heart-healthy kind) and the notion that saturated fat is unhealthy is being <a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/news/2014/03March/Pages/Saturated-fats-and-heart-disease-link-unproven.aspx\">questioned</a> too.

Take a knife with a thick blade and place the blade flat across the garlic clove (the clove should be closer to the handle than the middle of the blade). Whack down on the flat side of the blade with your free hand to smoosh the garlic a bit. Done correctly, the skin will peel right off.",

        instructions:
          "Pat dry the chicken with a paper towel and add salt and pepper\n\nIn a skillet, over medium heat, heat the olive oil\n\nAdd garlic, capers, anchovies, and hot pepper flakes. Make sure the oil is not too hot so it doesn’t burn the garlic.\n\nAfter about 5 minutes, the anchovies will have nearly disappeared and also all the other ingredients will have neatly flavored the oil\n\nAdd chicken and cook on both sides until done. Mine only took about 3 minutes per side due to their thinness .\n\nRemove chicken and set aside\n\nAdd butter to the hot oil and scrape all the bits and pieces off the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Then,within less than a minute, add the fresh lemon juice.\n\nNow is the perfect time to taste. Make sure you like the balance. There are a lot of strong flavored ingredients in here so make sure none of them wants to be in the front of your taste buds alone. Balance is the key here. Maybe it needs a little more lemon juice, or maybe butter. Maybe now you feel you’d like it spicier. No problem, add more hot pepper flakes. You know where I’m going with this. That’s when you are cooking! You are the cook, this recipe is just a guideline.  Make it yours.\n\nOnce the sauce it’s done, you can put the cooked chicken back in the pan for a minute, just to warm it up before serving\n\nServe on a warm plate, garnish with some flat leaf Italian parsley and a side of your choice. Another delicious way to serve is with your favorite salad and a nice french baguette to mop up the sauce.",

Many people recommend saving extra-virgin olive oil for cold dishes or for adding the finishing touch to a warm dish. You could also use canola oil, coconut oil, or another good <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/vegetable-oil\">high-temperature oil</a> to be on the safe side.",

In case you're wondering what the difference between capers and caper berries is, capers are flower buds, while caper berries are the product of the same flower buds being allowed to mature and produce fruits (i.e. the caper berries!) Most sources say the two are not interchangeable, as they differ in both size and flavor.",
            'Kosher salt is a type of coarse-grained salt popular among chefs because it is easy to pick up with the fingertips and sticks well when coating meat. The name "kosher salt" comes from the word "koshering", the process of making food suitable for consumption according to Jewish law. You can easily substitute table salt or sea salt in recipes where the salt is being dissolved, but if you\'re using it to coat meat, you might wish you had the kosher salt.',
            'Butter\'s incredible flavor has made it an extremely popular cooking fat, but it is important to know that butter has the lowest smoke point of almost any cooking fat. This means butter literally starts to smoke at a lower temperature than most other fats between 250-350 degrees Fahrenheit. So while butter is great for cooking at lower temperatures, you should probably use canola oil, coconut oil, or  <a href="https://spoonacular.com/academy/vegetable-oil">another oil with a higher smoke point</a> for frying and other high temperature cooking.',

            'Extra-virgin olive oil is the least refined type of olive oil and therefore contains more of the beneficial compounds that get lost during processing. However, its minimal processing could also mean it has a lower smoke point than other olive oils. Once an oil starts to smoke, it begins to break down, producing a bad flavor and potentially harmful compounds. Unfortunately, the smoke point of an oil depends on so many factors that it is hard to say what the smoke point of an oil really is. For extra-virgin olive oil, it could be anywhere between 200-400 degrees Fahrenheit. Most people recommend using extra-virgin olive oil to add flavor to a finished dish or in cold dishes to be on the safe side. More refined olive oils, canola oil,  coconut oil, and <a href="https://spoonacular.com/academy/butter">clarified butter/ghee</a> are better options for high temperature cooking.',

            "Tunan on the menu? Try pairing with Pinot Noir, Merlot, and rosé Wine. Though fish is often paired with white wine, 'meatier' fish like tuna can absolutely go with red wine. A Rosé will also pair nicely, particularly if your tunan is prepared with ingredients better suited to a white wine. The Stoltz Organic Pinot Noir with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 26 dollars per bottle.",

The perfect gift as it's extremely versatile and can be folded and carried in your bag!\nA Champagne House is eventually judged on the quality of its Brut Non Vintage. It is in the making of such a wine that the true Art of Champagne blending reveals itself.This is an art in which the House of Veuve Clicquot excels. Our Brut Yellow Label reflects the superb vineyards we own and the consistent nature of our House style.The predominance of Pinot Noir provides the structure that is so typically Clicquot, while a touch of Pinot Meunier rounds out the blend. Chardonnay adds the elegance and finesse essential in a perfectly balanced wine.",

            "Pinot Noir, Chardonnay, and Sauvignon Blanc are my top picks for Salmon. To decide on white or red, you should consider your seasoning and sauces. Chardonnay is a great friend to buttery, creamy dishes, while sauvignon blanc can complement herb or citrus-centric dishes. A light-bodied, low-tannin red such as the pinot noir goes great with broiled or grilled salmon. You could try Brooks Willamette Valley Pinot Noir. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.3 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 25 dollars per bottle.",

A wonderful high note of black tea, leather and potpourri. The wine is so luscious in the mouth, coating the palate with rich, dark cherry, warm raspberry, red currant and black plum. There is a wonderful earthiness of portabella mushrooms on the grill, roasted vegetables, bacon fat and smoked meats. This Pinotfinishes with ripe fruit, earth and complexity and a hint of tomato leaf and earthiness. Just delicious!",

            "Smoked Salmon works really well with Pinot Noir, Chardonnay, and Sauvignon Blanc. To decide on white or red, you should consider your seasoning and sauces. Chardonnay is a great friend to buttery, creamy dishes, while sauvignon blanc can complement herb or citrus-centric dishes. A light-bodied, low-tannin red such as the pinot noir goes great with broiled or grilled salmon. The Hartford Court Russian River Pinot Noir ( half-bottle) with a 4.6 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 22 dollars per bottle.",

            "Salmon works really well with Pinot Noir, Chardonnay, and Sauvignon Blanc. To decide on white or red, you should consider your seasoning and sauces. Chardonnay is a great friend to buttery, creamy dishes, while sauvignon blanc can complement herb or citrus-centric dishes. A light-bodied, low-tannin red such as the pinot noir goes great with broiled or grilled salmon. The Le Cadeau Vineyard Rocheux Pinot Noir with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 49 dollars per bottle.",

          "Instructions\n\n \n\nCollard Greens\n\nUsing a non-stick pan, heat extra-virgin olive oil over medium to medium-high heat. \n\nAdd the chopped collard greens. You want to hear a crackle when they touch the oil. Let it crackle for about 30 seconds, add salt, and stir. \n\nReduce the heat to medium and keep stirring for about 4 minutes. \n\nAdd red pepper flakes and garlic and stir for another minute or so. Just make sure the garlic doesn’t turn brown.\n\nRemove the collard greens from the pan, squeeze some fresh lemon juice over it, and set aside.\n\nSalmon\n\nPlace the salmon steak skin side down on your cutting board and use a paper towel to dry off any excess moisture. \n\nPour honey on top (use your hands or a brush and evenly coat the fish’s surface). Add salt and pepper.\n\nUse a paper towel to wipe clean the pan you used for the collard greens and heat the extra-virgin olive oil over medium-high heat. \n\nAdd the salmon with the skin side up. Yes, skin side up. That will achieve an incredible sear on the skinless side. Just make sure when you put the fish in the hot pan, do not move it for about 4 minutes.\n\nReduce heat and cook for another 4 minutes skin side down, to get the inside just slightly cooked (opaque), with still a little translucency in the center. The internal temperature should read 125°F.\n\nPlace on a bed of collard greens and serve immediately.",

            'Extra-virgin olive oil is the least refined type of olive oil and therefore contains more of the beneficial compounds that get lost during processing. However, its minimal processing could also mean it has a lower smoke point than other olive oils. Once an oil starts to smoke, it begins to break down, producing a bad flavor and potentially harmful compounds. Unfortunately, the smoke point of an oil depends on so many factors that it is hard to say what the smoke point of an oil really is. For extra-virgin olive oil, it could be anywhere between 200-400 degrees Fahrenheit. Most people recommend using extra-virgin olive oil to add flavor to a finished dish or in cold dishes to be on the safe side. More refined olive oils, canola oil,  coconut oil, and <a href="https://spoonacular.com/academy/butter">clarified butter/ghee</a> are better options for high temperature cooking.',

The name "kosher salt" comes from the word "koshering", the process of making food suitable for consumption according to Jewish law. You can easily substitute table salt or sea salt in recipes where the salt is being dissolved, but if you\'re using it to coat meat, you might wish you had the kosher salt.',

Sauvignon Blanc and Gruner Veltliner both have herby notes that complement salads with enough acid to match tart vinaigrettes, while a Chardonnay can be a good pick for creamy salad dressings. One wine you could try is Laguna Winery Russian River Chardonnay. It has 4.6 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 29 dollars.",

                "Nestled in the heart of the Russian River Valley, Laguna Ranch Vineyard has been home to world-class Chardonnay for the past 30 years. The vineyard owes its long growing season to the cool fog that rolls in from the Pacific Ocean, giving our Chardonnay grapes a delicate balance between crisp acidity and ripe fruit flavors. An elegant expression of its namesake vineyard, Laguna Ranch Vineyard Chardonnay is an exceptionally well-balanced and luxurious wine. Opens with notes of apple, pear, quince and tangerine, framed by sweet undertones of Asian spice. Well balanced and rich, this Chardonnay has an expressive mouthfeel and a layered, lingering finish.",

            'Extra-virgin olive oil is the least refined type of olive oil and therefore contains more of the beneficial compounds that get lost during processing. However, its minimal processing could also mean it has a lower smoke point than other olive oils. Once an oil starts to smoke, it begins to break down, producing a bad flavor and potentially harmful compounds. Unfortunately, the smoke point of an oil depends on so many factors that it is hard to say what the smoke point of an oil really is. For extra-virgin olive oil, it could be anywhere between 200-400 degrees Fahrenheit. Most people recommend using extra-virgin olive oil to add flavor to a finished dish or in cold dishes to be on the safe side. More refined olive oils, canola oil,  coconut oil, and <a href="https://spoonacular.com/academy/butter">clarified butter/ghee</a> are better options for high temperature cooking.',
