If you are trying to reduce salt in your diet, you can try salt substitutes like potassium chloride or try to make do with less salt by using more black pepper, herbs, and spices.',

Many people recommend saving extra-virgin olive oil for cold dishes or for adding the finishing touch to a warm dish. You could also use canola oil, coconut oil, or another good <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/vegetable-oil\">high-temperature oil</a> to be on the safe side.",

Brown rice is a whole grain, while white rice is brown rice stripped of some of its parts and much of its fiber and other nutrients. It is important to note, however, that all rice types raise your <a href="http://www.health.harvard.edu/newsweek/Glycemic_index_and_glycemic_load_for_100_foods.htm">blood sugar</a> and should be eaten in moderation. In fact, if it seems like it would work in the recipe, the best option would probably be so-called <a href="http://spoonacular.com/Another-(simpler)-Version-Of-Cauliflower-Rice-30679">cauliflower rice</a>.',

            "Sea salt is not healthier than table salt, contrary to what you may have heard. Sea salt is usually 97.5% sodium chloride (same as regular old table salt) and the minerals accounting for the rest are too insignificant to make a difference?unless you plan on consuming sea salt by the pound, in which case the health benefits from the minerals will definitely be outweighed by the negative effects of all the sodium you are consuming!",
            'Although the body needs salt to survive, most of us get too much. The problem with consuming too much salt (what chemists call "sodium chloride") is actually the <a href="https://spoonacular.com/academy/sodium">sodium</a> part, which is why people concerned about high blood pressure go on low-sodium diets. If you are trying to reduce salt in your diet, you can try salt substitutes like potassium chloride or try to make do with less salt by using more black pepper, herbs, and spices.',

So if you have expensive sea salt, save it for sprinkling on salads or dark chocolate cookies, don't try to use it in your pasta sauce or soup.

Sauvignon Blanc and Gruner Veltliner both have herby notes that complement salads with enough acid to match tart vinaigrettes, while a Chardonnay can be a good pick for creamy salad dressings.

                'Fine yellow-green gold color. The opulent, forward fruit strongly manifests itself with rich, pear-honey and vanilla extract aromas, with overtones of fresh herbs and marzipan. Very full, lush flavors reveal integrated, typically Carneros, ripe apple and peachy fruit combined with the spicy vanilla-cinnamon elements of oak. The finish is creamy, round, and toasty, neither "charry" nor resiny, the oak finely balanced the powerful fruit. This is a luxuriously textured, high extract wine; a great foil for rich fish dishes, savory chicken, or a veal roast.',

            "Salt Cod works really well with Pinot Noir, Pinot Grigio, and Gruener Veltliner. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or GrÃ¼ner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Calista Coast Range Pinot Noir with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 25 dollars per bottle.",

            "White Wine, Alcoholic Drink, and Ingredient are my top picks for Chicken Wings. White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Simonnet-Febvre Chablis Vaillons Premier Cru. It has 4.6 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 28 dollars.",

          "Wash the chicken pieces thoroughly & pat dry with a paper towel.\nMake incisions with a sharp knife on thick parts of the chicken pieces deep enough to reach the bone.\nApply a mixture one tablespoon lemon juice and salt over the chicken and set aside for half an hour.\nFor the marinade, tie up yogurt in a piece of muslin /cheese cloth and hang over a bowl for fifteen to twenty minutes.\nRemove the thick yogurt into another bowl. Beat the yogurt for about 2 minutes to remove all lumps .Add the remaining ingredients of the marinade to the yogurt and mix well.\nRub this marinade over the chicken pieces.Put the chicken pieces and marinade in a bowl ,cover the bowl with a plastic wrap and marinate overnight or for at least 6-7 hours in a refrigerator.\nFor cooking , you can do any one of the following:\nThis is what I do: Preheat the oven at 450 F broiler mode.Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and arrange the chicken pieces on it.Brush the marinated chicken pieces with oil/butter. Tip the sheet inside the oven on top rack and cook for about 22-25 minutes flipping it after 15 minutes till chicken is done but still tender.You may get some burnt marks on the chicken but thats okay!After the chicken is done,take a small bowl and light a little piece of charcoal in it.Tranfer the chicken to a big bowl and in between,place the small bowl with charcoal and cover with a aluminium foil for about 5 minutes.This will infuse the chicken with smoky flavor.Be very careful doing this.Take care that there should be no vivible flame on the charcoal piece,only fumes!\nGrill and cook the chicken for 2o minutes till done and but still tender.\nBake it in the oven for 25-30 minutes at 400 F,turning and basting with oil.\nPierce the chicken with toothpick/fork to check if it is done.\nServe with mint & coriander chutney, onion rings, lemon wedges and  sliced tomatoes. You can sprinkle some chaat masala also if you want.",

A wonderful high note of black tea, leather and potpourri. The wine is so luscious in the mouth, coating the palate with rich, dark cherry, warm raspberry, red currant and black plum. There is a wonderful earthiness of portabella mushrooms on the grill, roasted vegetables, bacon fat and smoked meats. This Pinotfinishes with ripe fruit, earth and complexity and a hint of tomato leaf and earthiness. Just delicious!",

However, its minimal processing could also mean it has a lower smoke point than other olive oils.

Unfortunately, the smoke point of an oil depends on so many factors that it is hard to say what the smoke point of an oil really is. For extra-virgin olive oil, it could be anywhere between 200-400 degrees Fahrenheit.

White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices.

The Granny Smith apples are diced quite small and then cooked in a reduction of honey, apple cider vinegar and spices. Granny Smiths are good to use because they won't break down into apple sauce during the cooking. The cooked apples are then used as a top crust and glaze for the roast pork. Some garlic roast potatoes and steamed veggies completed a wonderful family meal. Here's your Sunday supper!</p><p>Lb pork loin or rib roast</p><p>Season the pork with salt and pepper and open roast on a rack in a roasting pan at 375 degrees F for about a half hour.</p><p>Meanwhile dice very small, (about a 1/4 inch dice)</p><p>Large Granny Smith apples, peeled and cored</p><p>In a large saute pan over medium heat add:</p><p>Tbsp olive oil</p><p>Cloves minced garlic</p><p>Cook for a minute or two to soften but not brown the garlic.

Return the roast to the oven, reduce the heat to 350 degrees F and cook uncovered until the internal temperature reaches 170 degrees F on a meat thermomether inserted into the center of the roast. Allow the pork to rest for about 15 minutes before carving and serving.</p>",

            "Pinot Noir, Malbec, and Sangiovese are my top picks for Pork Medallions. Pinot noir's light body is great for lean cuts, medium bodied sangiovese complement meaty sauces, stews, and other multi-ingredient dishes, and full-bodied tannic malbec pairs with fatty cuts and barbecue. You could try Le Cadeau Vineyard Rocheux Pinot Noir. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 49 dollars per bottle.",

            "Pork Tenderloin on the menu? Try pairing with Pinot Noir, Malbec, and Sangiovese. Pinot noir's light body is great for lean cuts, medium bodied sangiovese complement meaty sauces, stews, and other multi-ingredient dishes, and full-bodied tannic malbec pairs with fatty cuts and barbecue. The Flowers Sea View Ridge Estate Pinot Noir with a 4.6 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 67 dollars per bottle.",

Chardonnay suits simple chops or chops in a butter or cream sauce, dry riesling complements sweet additions like honey mustard or apples, and pinot noir is a safe bet for pork dishes in general. The Hartford Court Russian River Pinot Noir ( half-bottle) with a 4.6 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 22 dollars per bottle.",

            "Here's a trick for peeling garlic quickly. Put the garlic clove on your cutting board. Take a knife with a thick blade and place the blade flat across the garlic clove (the clove should be closer to the handle than the middle of the blade). Whack down on the flat side of the blade with your free hand to smoosh the garlic a bit. Done correctly, the skin will peel right off.",
            'If parmesan plays a big role in the flavor of your dish (or if you\'re a serious foodie or serious about avoiding additivies) it might be worth your time to track down <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/larryolmsted/2012/11/19/the-dark-side-of-parmesan-cheese-what-you-dont-know-might-hurt-you">"true" parmesan</a>, Parmigiano Reggiano.',
            'Extra-virgin olive oil is the least refined type of olive oil and therefore contains more of the beneficial compounds that get lost during processing. However, its minimal processing could also mean it has a lower smoke point than other olive oils. Once an oil starts to smoke, it begins to break down, producing a bad flavor and potentially harmful compounds. Unfortunately, the smoke point of an oil depends on so many factors that it is hard to say what the smoke point of an oil really is. For extra-virgin olive oil, it could be anywhere between 200-400 degrees Fahrenheit. Most people recommend using extra-virgin olive oil to add flavor to a finished dish or in cold dishes to be on the safe side. More refined olive oils, canola oil,  coconut oil, and <a href="https://spoonacular.com/academy/butter">clarified butter/ghee</a> are better options for high temperature cooking.',

            "Chicken Wings works really well with White Wine, Alcoholic Drink, and Ingredient. White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. The PRONTO Lambrusco Secco with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 20 dollars per bottle.",

Meanwhile, prepare the marinade/glaze by adding all ingredients (minus the honey) to a food processor. Pulse until smooth and completely mixed through. Transfer to a saucepan and add the 2 tbsp honey. Bring to a boil until thickened, 5 minutes. Keep ready until basting.\n3. Bake the wings for about 30 minutes while basting them frequently every 10 minutes or so.\n4. After 30 minutes, set to broil and let cook for another 15~20 minutes while basting with remaining glaze. Broiling near the end creates crispier and crunchier wings that we personally enjoy.\n5. When wings are charred and slightly burned, transfer to a serving plate. Let cool for several minutes and garnish with thinly sliced scallion and/or toasted sesame seeds. Enjoy!!",
